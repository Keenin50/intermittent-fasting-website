        <p>Intermittent fasting works by cycling between periods of fasting and eating, allowing your body to burn fat more efficiently. Here's how you can get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose your fasting window (e.g., 16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating).</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated during your fasting periods (water, herbal teas, etc.).</li>
            <li>Eat balanced meals during the eating window.</li>
        </ol>
